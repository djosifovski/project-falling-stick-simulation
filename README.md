# Falling Stick Simulation

This project investigates the dynamics of a falling stick through theoretical derivation and numerical simulation. Key components include:
- **Lagrangian Derivation**: Derived the Lagrangian equation governing the motion of a stick falling under gravity, accounting for its length and initial conditions.
- **Numerical Simulation**: Implemented the Euler and Runge-Kutta numerical methods to compute the falling time of the stick based on its initial angle and length.
- **Experimental Validation**: Conducted experiments to measure the falling time of a 15 cm long pen, providing empirical validation for the numerical simulations.
